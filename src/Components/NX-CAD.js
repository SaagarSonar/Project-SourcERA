              IFS Academy is SIEMENS PLM Software Authorised Educational Partner
              in India conducting certified NX CAD Electrical Routing Wiring
              Harness Design Online Training. This course will introduce you to
              the fundamental concepts of NX CAD. You will learn how to design
              parts and assemblies and create simple drawings. Once you are
              familiar with the fundamentals, you will be introduced to the
              Electrical Library products.
            </p>
            <p>
              The NX Electrical Routing course is designed to teach you the
              basics of Electrical Routing as it applies to the design of wiring
              harnesses and connectors. You will cover basic electrical routing
              terminology, electrical design process, parts, paths, terminals,
              and stock. Upon completion of this course, youâ€™ll be ready to
              start designing your own wiring harnesses and connectors. We offer
              two courses basic and advanced.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Routing Electrical course also illustrates how to create
              connection and component lists, how to qualify parts for use in
              routing assemblies, how to place parts in a wiring assembly, or to
              create and edit wiring paths, how to assign components and
              connectors (manually and automatically), and how to create
              formboards.Automotive Wiring Harness/ Cabling design has been a
              prime importance in functional performance of a vehicle. Industry
              need expertise that will help them in innovative high efficient
              and low cost design.

              NX offers a fully integrated 3D electrical routing and wire
              harness design application that allows you to design and route
              harnesses in complex assemblies. The electrical routing tools
              provide smart features and functions to automate the design,
              modification and analysis of wire harnesses. The powerful design
              and manufacturing capabilities available in NX electrical routing
              enable users to produce a wire harness directly from NX product
              assembly models. The need to build a physical prototype before
              producing the wire harnesses is eliminated, significantly reducing
              product development time. 3D Electrical Wiring and Harness Design
              is made up of powerful features that allow you to build a custom
              solution.
